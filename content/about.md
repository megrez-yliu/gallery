This visual field guide is a collection of photos featuring wildlife, primarily birds, that I've personally identified. I will focus on showcasing the key characteristics of different species.

There is also a small (but growing) collection of astronomy photos that I've taken over the years.

## About me
I am a software engineer living in Los Angeles. I started birding in 2021. Southern California's mild winters and springs are prime time for me to go birdwatching. I also use my bird photography gear for astrophotography.

## Birding

The Cornell Lab of Ornithology provides these resources for birders.

To plan for your stargazing trip, check these
* Light pollution & sky quality - [Clear Sky Chart](https://www.cleardarksky.com/csk/)
* Weather, especially evening temperatures and cloud coverage - [Windy](https://www.windy.com)
* Preview the night sky and make note of the direction & height of the target objects - [Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/)
  * Avoid big cities that lie in the direction where you need to look.
* Campsites if staying overnight.
