This visual field guide is a collection of photos featuring wildlife, primarily birds, that I've personally identified. I will focus on showcasing the key characteristics of different species.

## About me
I am a software engineer living in Los Angeles. I started birding in 2021. Southern California's mild winters and springs are prime time for me to go birdwatching. I also enjoy spotting new species when I travel.

## Places I go
Check my recommended birding locations on [this map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/2/edit?mid=19s2gx4bAf_ru1_qYl6oOHykn7a-XnuU&usp=sharing).

## To learn about birds and identify them
The Cornell Lab of Ornithology provides these resources for birders.
* Search on [All About Birds](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/) for species info.
* Explore hotspots and recent sightings on [Ebird](https://ebird.org/explore).
* Use the [Merlin app](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) to help you identify birds.

**The Sibley Guide to Birds** is a great guide with detailed illustrations of North American birds.
